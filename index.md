## Introduction

Hello my name is Christian Torres, I am an Electrical Systems Engineering student at Arizona State University. My current engineering interests involve IC manufacturing and development. I also have a passion for environmental science and learning about new ways to maintain sustainability and reduce the environmental impact of current industries. This site is meant to be my personal site for my own work and career accomplishments but also available to those as recuiters. Thank you!

## Projects
* Senior Capstone Design Project (Currently Under NDA)  
    * Currently in the development of a portable Direct Air Capture (DAC) device that will capture CO2 from air and extract it to be used in another process or demonstration type. CO2 data will be taken directly from a sensor and transmitted to a database for monitoring CO2 yield.  
* Non-Title V Air Emissions Permit for Maricopa County (ERM 494)  
    * Developed a Non-Title V Air Emissions Permit for a mock aerospace manufacturing facility in accordance with the Clean Air Act. Permit also created in accordance with local county air pollution regulations. These include Rules: 241, 310, 323, 324, 348. 
    * Calculations of PM 2.5/10, SO2, NOx, VOCs, CO2, and HAPS conducted during the project done using specifications from manufacturers of specific machine equipment.
    * Drafted Permit Here: [Air Permit Application, Conditions, Calculations.pdf](https://github.com/cltorre3/cltorre3.github.io/files/10574946/Air.Permit.Application.Conditions.Calculations.pdf)
* Robotic Grip Aid for Disabled Persons "Bionic Aid" (EGR 314)  
    *   Created and helped develop a prototype of an exoskeletal hand that allows the user to have a robotically sealed grip that is controlled by wires embedded in the hand. These wires are reeled in when pressure applied to the sensor indicates release, allowing the user to grip the object with control until the release of the hand. 
    * Personally in charge of PCB design, production, assembly. Also implemented own temperature sensor onto system to prevent damage from possible overcurrent.   
    * Booth Presentation & Board Design:
