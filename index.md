## Projects
* Senior Capstone Design Project (Currently Under NDA)  
    * Currently in the development of a portable Direct Air Capture (DAC) device that will capture CO2 from air and extract it to be used in another process or demonstration type. CO2 data will be taken directly from a sensor and transmitted to a database for monitoring CO2 yield.  
* Non-Title V Air Emissions Permit for Maricopa County (ERM 494)  
    * Developed a Non-Title V Air Emissions Permit for a mock aerospace manufacturing facility in accordance with the Clean Air Act. Permit also created in accordance with local county air pollution regulations. These include Rules: 241, 310, 323, 324, 348. 
    * Calculations of PM 2.5/10, SO2, NOx, VOCs, CO2, and HAPS conducted during the project done using specifications from manufacturers of specific machine equipment.
    * Drafted Permit Here: [Air Permit Application, Conditions, Calculations.pdf](https://github.com/cltorre3/cltorre3.github.io/files/10574946/Air.Permit.Application.Conditions.Calculations.pdf)
* Robotic Grip Aid for Disabled Persons "Bionic Aid" (EGR 314)  
    *   Created and helped develop a prototype of an exoskeletal hand that allows the user to have a robotically sealed grip that is controlled by wires embedded in the hand. These wires are reeled in when pressure applied to the sensor indicates release, allowing the user to grip the object with control until the release of the hand. 
    * Personally in charge of PCB design, production, assembly. Also implemented own temperature sensor onto system for temperature monitoring. Temperature sensor was an analog using a thermistor in a non-inverting Op Amp configuration.
    * I also personally hand soldered every component on this board.
    * Booth Presentation & Board Design:

* Active Digital Signal Processing Speaker Crossover (EGR 334)
    * Helped create and develop an active digital signal processing program that takes a single input signal and seperates it into a high, band, and low pass signal. This was done utilizing Python and a Raspberry Pi.
    * Github does not support mp3 or wav files, therefore it is zipped below:     
             * Original File: Chicago.wav  
             * High Pass Conversion: HighPassAudio.wav  
             * Low Pass Conversion: LowPassAudio.wav  
             * Band Pass Conversion: BandPassAudio.wav  
             * File: [Active DSP Files.zip](https://github.com/cltorre3/cltorre3.github.io/files/10671678/Active.DSP.Files.zip)  

* PID System for Motor RPM Under Load (EGR 330)  
    * Helped create and develop a PID controller system for driving a motor attached to a generator. The goal was to use the PID to maintain the motor at the same RPM when a load was attached to the generator.
    * See Video: [Project Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f3oaLfIXC9qrUkXi268p7UAyDMRYr4F8/view?usp=share_link)
* Mini Jack & Vise Creation (EGR 294)  
	* Created a Mini Jack utilizing a lathe. Multiple materials cut including steel, aluminum, delrin, and anonized aluminum. Multiple operations performed include turning, chamfering, parting, tapering, and threading. Also included heat treatment and sand blasting.
    * Created a Mini Vise utilizing a manual Bridgeport Mill. Multiple operations were included in its machining including face milling, reaming, CNC, saw, and thread tapping.
    * All tolerances kept within 0.005 inches per GD & T. 

## Published Reports
* Worked on the ASU Project Cities partnership with the City of Peoria for idenitfying and implementating more sustainable practices for the city. My work involved research into the growing amount of E-Waste that the city faced. I researched to find the most sustainable, ethical, and enviornmentally friendly practices that were available to the City of Peoria. This was done in collaboration with multiple members as a team.
